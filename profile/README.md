# Lineage OS Revived

A fork of Lineage with the goal to simplify building older versions without the need to pick security patches from the [LineageOS gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org) or [lin18-microg](https://codeberg.org/lin18-microg)  
Also includes misc fixes and perfomance improvements from [crDroid](https://github.com/crdroidandroid), some hardening from [Divest OS](https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/DivestOS-Build/tree/master/Patches)

Currently the following branches are supported and tested:
- lineage-18.1
- cm-14.1
