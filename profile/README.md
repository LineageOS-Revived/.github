# Lineage OS Revived

A fork of Lineage with the goal to simplify building older versions without the need to pick security patches from the [LineageOS gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org) and [Divest OS](https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/DivestOS-Build/tree/master/Patches).

Also includes misc fixes and perfomance improvements from [crDroid](https://github.com/crdroidandroid), theme updates from [LightningFastRom](https://github.com/LightningFastRom) and signature spoofing support from [Mint OS](https://github.com/Mint-OS).
